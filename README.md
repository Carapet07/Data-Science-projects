# heart-attack-prediction-ml
In this project, I developed a model to predict the likelihood of a person having a heart attack, with predictions labeled as 0 (lower risk) and 1 (higher risk). The workflow includes data splitting, preprocessing, and the application of both regression and classification models. I utilized XGBoost to determine which approach yields the best performance.
