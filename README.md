# Heart Attack Prediction
In this project, I developed a model to predict the likelihood of a person having a heart attack, with predictions labeled as 0 (lower risk) and 1 (higher risk). The workflow includes data splitting, preprocessing, and the application of both regression and classification models. I utilized XGBoost to determine which approach yields the best performance.
# Boston Pricing:
In this project, I built a deep learning regression model to predict Boston housing prices, preprocessing the data with scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets. I trained the model with early stopping and used Matplotlib to visualize the training and validation loss over time.
